            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">Located in the Nipissing District of northeastern
                Ontario, Temagami
                encompasses over 16,000 square kilometers and is a popular destination for those seeking to explore the
                outdoors through canoeing, hiking, and camping.
                Friends of Temagami non-profit organization, operated by volunteers, has been advocating for the
                protection and exploration of Temagami since its inception in 1995. The organization relies on map
                sales, donations, and membership fees to support activities such as infrastructure maintenance, mapping,
                and conservation efforts.
                <br>
                <br>
                Friends of Temagami has identified the need to increase their online presence and has hired Temagami
                Consulting Group to develop a suite of web applications. The main priority is the development of a
                reporting system where visitors can submit maintenance requests for campsites, trails, and portages, as
                well as GPS tracks and other trip related information. To address this, Temagami Consulting Group has
                created an online application that allows users to submit this type of data as well as view the
                submissions of others. This solution includes an operational map layer that provides geographic context
                by including notable features such as campsites and portages that users may reference on a GPS device
                during their trips.

                Additionally, Friends of Temagami has requested a way of improving public accessibility to information
                about the organization and the Temagami region in general. For this purpose, Temagami Consulting Group
                has produced a regional wall map and an Esri Story Map.

            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">FOT provided a geodatabase containing campsite and
                portage features and
                all other data was collected by TCG.
                <br>Spatial data used in the Story Map and wall map were sourced from the Government of Canada's
                geospatial data extraction portal, GeoGratis, as well as FOT’s website. The wall map also utilized
                imagery from USGS’ Earth Explorer.​
                <br>Photos used in the Story Map were collected from FOT’s website and the public via crowdsourcing over
                social media.

            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">We imported the campsite and portage features into
                ArcGIS Pro,
                projected the data, cleaned up the fields and tested different symbologies on top of various basemaps
                until we ultimately created a design that contains simple yet prominent features that
                compliment a variety of different basemap styles. The layers were then exported as KMLs, to be
                compatible for upload to Avenza Maps, a mapping application popular among backcountry campers. ​
                These layers provide additional geographic context to facilitate accurate data collection, as users may
                reference the campsite and portage features when adding points or drawing tracks.​</p>

                this application,
                allowing users to submit spatial data, comments, and media pertaining to their Temagami trips.
                Crowdsource Manager serves as the back-end infrastructure, enabling an administrator to view and edit
                the user submitted data.​​</p>

                The user input is stored in 2 different hosted feature layers, one for maintenance which stores points
                only, and the other for trip data, which can store points and polylines. The attributes were configured
                to control what kind of data that the users could input.</p>

            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">
                Web maps were created to hold these features and filters were added to control public visbility of newly
                submitted reports.</p>

            <h5 data-aos="fade-up">PYTHON SCRIPT</h5>
            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">
                A Python script was wrriten to assist in processing spatial data submitted through a file attachment
                data, to make it suitable for being appended to the hosted layers in ArcGIS Online.
                The script has been designed to process KMLs and Shapefiles as we anticipate those will be the most
                common spatial data formats. 
                In order to append this data to the layer in ArcGIS Online, the schemas must match. So the script also
                adds all of the necessary fields, populates them with default values, and removes any unnecessary fields
                to create a consistent schema. ​ ​

                amalgamating all user
                submitted data into one location, where it can be publicly viewed.
                A web map containing all relevant layers (campsites, portages, maintenance report points, trip report
                observations and tracks) was created for use in the Dashboard.
                Widgets were configured to allow users to view and interact with the data.

                proof of concept of how
                this tool can be used to create resources that display information in an interactive, visually appealing
                manner.

                The overall structure is built using an Esri StoryMap Series, which allows StoryMaps, webpages, and
                other applications to be embedded into tabs that may be selected from a top menu.

                Five tabs have been created for the StoryMap series: Home, History, Visit, Operating Provincial Parks,
                and Non-Operating Provincial Parks.

            <p style="color:rgb(211, 211, 211);" data-aos="fade-up">The wall map was created to accentuate and display
                terrain, with a
                focus on the Wolf Lake area in Temagami.
                LandsatLook data was downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer, and mosaiced, pansharpened, and adjusted using
                Geographic Imager in Adobe Photoshop.
                A DEM was downloaded from STRM data and imported to ArcMap, where it was projected, clipped and exported
                as a .tif image. This DEM was then used to create Hillshade and Slopeshade surfaces using different
                settings for vertical exaggeration.

                After creating the individual terrain surfaces, Geographic Imager was used to import them onto Adobe
                Photoshop to integrate the different layers, add masks, colour, and texture.
                Finally, Adobe Illustrator and MAPublisher were used to create the map layout.

            <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);" data-aos="fade-up">Trip Reports are intended to capture leisure related trip
                information such as wildlife sightings, points of interest, and canoe and hiking routes. If users select
                Trip Report, a drop down will appear which prompts the user to select either Observations, which
                represents point data, or Tracks, which represents line data. Once the user makes a selection a
                pre-configured map will be displayed that also includes campsites and portages.

                Observations may be added using the same methods as the Maintenance Reporter, and Tracks may
                be submitted either by manually drawing lines (e.g. retracing a canoe or hiking route from memory or
                reproducing a route hand drawn on a paper map), or by attaching a zipped folder containing spatial data
                with the report.

                uploaded through Crowdsource Reporter can be viewed and managed in the configured Crowdsource Manager
                application.

                Attached zip files can be downloaded from the Info tab in Crowdsource Manager. If desired, photos can be
                saved by right clicking on them in the Media tab.

                A Python script assists in altering the submitted spatial data to make it compatible with being appended
                to the hosted feature layer in ArcGIS Online. Running the script on a folder containing the zipped files
                downloaded from Crowdsource Reporter will create a geodatabase containing a feature for each KML/KMZ or
                Shapefile in the input folder. These geodatabases will contain feature classes that have schemas
                matching the hosted feature layers in AGOL.

                demonstrate the capabilities of ArcGIS StoryMaps. It was designed to showcase information about FOT as
                well as the Temagami region, which a person visiting for the first time would find useful. The Story
                Maps are configured with various photos, maps, a timeline, and map tour widgets.

                the area. Supplemental text was added that discusses the significance of this area, being home to the
                world’s largest remaining old-growth red pine forest, and the risks the region faces due to mining
                exploration, as well as actions that could be taken to save it. A neutral, natural colour palette was
                used for the surrounding elements to compliment the terrain surface. The dimensions of the map are 27.5
                x 19.3”, making it a great size to hang in any space.
